<h3><i>Computer-based method to identify antimicrobial peptides embedded in proteins</i><h3>

This repository contains the datasets used in the work entitled "Embedded-AMP: A multi-thread computational method for the systematic identification of antimicrobial peptides embedded in proteome sequences" by German Melendrez Carballo, Karen Guerrero Vazquez, Luis A. Garcia-Gonzalez, Gabriel Del Rio and Carlos A. Brizuela.

We provide the AMP/non-AMP dataset used to train SVMAMP and the proteomes that were used to validate the efficiency of the codes reported in that work.

The proteomes of organisms with a longevity reported at the <a href="https://genomics.senescence.info/species/index.html">AnAge database</a> are also included in the <i>datasets</i> directory.
